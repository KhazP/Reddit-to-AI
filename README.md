## Overview

**Reddit to AI** is a Chrome browser extension designed to streamline the process of understanding Reddit threads using Artificial Intelligence. It empowers users to quickly scrape the rich content of an active Reddit thread‚Äîincluding the original post and comments‚Äîand then uses Large Language Model (LLM) APIs to generate a summary of the content. The summary is delivered directly to the user via a system notification.

This tool aids researchers, avid Reddit users, and anyone looking for quick insights from online discussions without manual copy-pasting or opening new tabs. **Note: This extension requires you to provide your own API key for an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) to function.**

---
## ‚ú® Core Functionality

* **Comprehensive Data Scraping**: Extracts post details (title, author, subreddit, content) and a hierarchical tree of comments. Image data (URLs and content) is also scraped.
* **Background Summarization**: Utilizes LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini) to summarize the scraped content in the background.
* **User Configuration**:
    * Set comment scraping depth ("load more attempts").
    * Option to include hidden/collapsed comments.
    * Configure LLM provider, API key, and optional model name for summarization.
    * Customize the prompt template used for summarization.
    * Toggle desktop notifications for status updates and summaries.
* **Process Management**: Initiate, manage, and stop the scraping and summarization process.
* **User Feedback**: Real-time status messages and progress bar in the extension popup.
* **Notifications**: Delivers generated summaries directly via system notifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Briefly

1.  **User Configures**: Through the Options page, the user selects an LLM provider, enters their API key, and optionally specifies a model.
2.  **User Initiates**: On a Reddit page, the user clicks the extension icon and then the "Scrape & Summarize" button.
3.  **Service Worker Orchestrates**: The background script (`service_worker.js`) manages the entire flow.
4.  **Reddit Scraper (`redditScraper.js`)**: Injected into the active Reddit tab to extract post and comment data.
5.  **API Call**: The service worker sends the scraped content (formatted with a prompt template) to the configured LLM API.
6.  **Notification Delivery**: The API's response (the summary) is displayed as a system notification.
7.  **Data Handling**: Uses `chrome.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.session` for temporary data transfer (based on user setting) and `chrome.storage.sync` for persistent settings like API keys. API keys are stored in `chrome.storage.sync` and should be handled with care.

To load this extension for development or testing:

1.  **Download or Clone**: Get the project files onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    ```
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode**: Ensure the "Developer mode" toggle is on.
4.  **Load Unpacked**: Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's root folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).
5.  **Verify**: "Reddit to AI" should appear in your extensions list and its icon in the Chrome toolbar.

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Initial Setup (Important!)**:
    *   Open the extension's **Options** page (click the extension icon, then "Options").
    *   In the "Background Summarization Settings" section:
        *   a. Select your preferred **LLM Provider** (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini).
        *   b. Enter your **API Key** for the chosen provider. **This key is necessary for the summarization feature to work.** It is stored in your browser's sync storage. Please handle your API keys securely.
        *   c. (Optional) Specify a **Model Name** if you wish to use a particular model from your provider (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`). If left blank, a default model for the selected provider will be used.
    *   Configure other general settings like "Scraping Depth" or "Default Prompt Template" as needed.
    *   Ensure settings are saved (saving is typically automatic on change).

2.  **Summarizing a Thread**:
    *   Navigate to a Reddit thread page you want to summarize.
    *   Click the "Reddit to AI" toolbar icon.
    *   Optionally, toggle "Include Collapsed Comments."
    *   Click the **"Scrape and Send"** button (this will now perform scraping and then background summarization).
    *   The popup shows progress. Once complete, a system notification will appear with the summary.

## üîß Configuration

All settings are managed via the **"Options"** page, accessible from the extension popup:

*   **General Settings**:
    *   **Scraping Depth**: Slider to control how many "load more" comment iterations are attempted (Default: 75, Range: 1-500).
    *   **Default Prompt Template**: Customize the prompt sent to the LLM. Use `{content}` as a placeholder for the scraped Reddit data.
*   **Background Summarization Settings**:
    *   **Select LLM Provider**: Choose between available LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini).
    *   **API Key**: Input your API key for the selected provider. **Required for summarization.**
    *   **Model Name (Optional)**: Specify a particular model from your provider.
*   **Notification Settings**:
    *   **Show Notifications**: Checkbox to enable/disable all status and summary notifications (Default: Enabled).
*   **Advanced Settings**:
    *   **Data Storage**: Choose how scraped content is stored temporarily (`Don't save`, `Session only`, `Persistent`).

Settings are saved using `chrome.storage.sync` (for most settings including API keys) or `chrome.storage.local`/`chrome.storage.session` for temporary data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

* **API Costs**: Using LLM APIs incurs costs based on your usage with the respective provider (OpenAI, Google). Monitor your API usage.
* **API Key Security**: While stored in `chrome.storage.sync` (which syncs across your logged-in Chrome profiles), be mindful of the general security implications of storing API keys in browser storage. Revoke keys if you suspect compromise.
* **Rate Limiting**: Frequent or large summarization requests may hit API rate limits imposed by the LLM provider.
* **Content Cleaning**: Minor Reddit UI elements or markdown might occasionally be included in the content sent for summarization.
* **Performance**: Very large threads can be resource-intensive to scrape.
* **Summarization Quality**: The quality and relevance of summaries depend on the LLM provider, the chosen model, and the prompt template.

---
## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* More LLM provider options.
* Granular control over content sent for summarization (e.g., exclude certain comment trees).
* Option to view full summary history.
* Direct data export (JSON, TXT) of scraped content.
