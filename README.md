## Overview

**Reddit to AI** is a Chrome browser extension designed to streamline the process of analyzing Reddit threads using Artificial Intelligence. It empowers users to quickly scrape the rich content of an active Reddit thread‚Äîincluding the original post, comments, images, and links‚Äîand then seamlessly send this data to a selected AI chat interface (such as Google's Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or AI Studio).

This tool tackles the inefficiency of manual copy-pasting, aiding researchers, avid Reddit users, and anyone looking to leverage AI for deeper insights from online discussions.

---
## ‚ú® Core Functionality

* **Comprehensive Data Scraping**: Extracts post details (title, author, subreddit, content, images, links, YouTube URLs) and a hierarchical tree of comments.
* **User Configuration**:
    * Set comment scraping depth ("load more attempts").
    * Option to include hidden/collapsed comments.
    * Select target AI model (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, AI Studio).
    * Toggle desktop notifications.
* **Process Management**: Initiate, manage, and stop the scraping process.
* **User Feedback**: Real-time status messages and progress bar in the extension popup.
* **AI Platform Integration**: Opens the selected AI platform and attempts to paste scraped text and images. Supports YouTube URL pasting for AI Studio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Briefly

1.  **User Initiates**: Click the extension icon on a Reddit page and configure options in the popup.
2.  **Service Worker Orchestrates**: The background script (`service_worker.js`) manages the flow.
3.  **Reddit Scraper (`redditScraper.js`)**: Injected into Reddit to extract data.
4.  **AI Paster (`aiPaster.js`)**: Injected into the chosen AI platform to paste the content.
5.  **Data Handling**: Uses `chrome.storage.local` for temporary data transfer and `chrome.storage.sync` for persistent settings. No data is sent to external servers by the extension itself.
