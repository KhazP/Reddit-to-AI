# Privacy Policy for Reddit to AI

**Last Updated:** December 30, 2024

## Overview

Reddit to AI is a browser extension that helps you transfer Reddit thread content to AI chat platforms. **Your privacy is our priority** — all data processing happens locally in your browser.

---

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
**Nothing.** This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.

### What Stays Local
The following data is stored **only in your browser** using Chrome's local storage:
- Your extension settings and preferences
- Scraped thread history (for your convenience)
- Selected language preference

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `activeTab` | To read the current Reddit page when you click "Scrape" |
| `scripting` | To inject the scraper script into Reddit pages |
| `storage` | To save your settings and scrape history locally |
| `tabs` | To open AI platform tabs and paste content |
| `notifications` | To show status updates (optional, can be disabled) |

### Host Permissions
- `reddit.com` — To scrape thread content
- `gemini.google.com`, `chatgpt.com`, `claude.ai`, `aistudio.google.com` — To paste content into AI chat interfaces

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data** with third parties. The scraped Reddit content is sent directly from your browser to the AI platform you choose — we have no servers in between.

---

## Third-Party Services

When you use this extension to send content to AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.), that content is subject to **their** privacy policies:
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally:
- **Delete your data** anytime by clearing extension storage or uninstalling
- **Export your data** using the extension's JSON export feature
- **No account required** — use the extension anonymously
